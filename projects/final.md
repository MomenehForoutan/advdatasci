### Background

Faculty members are frequently evaluated on the basis of their methodological and collaborative work. There has been a large amount of effort dedicated to quantifying and measuring the output of faculty members. Here are a couple of examples:

### Your Project:

Your project is to quantify the level of collaborative and methodological work performed by the tenure-track faculty at the following departments:

* Johns Hopkins Biostatistics
* University of Washington Biostatistics
* University of Minnesota Biostatistics
* Stanford Statistics
* Iowa State Statistics
* University of Chicago Statistics

If time permits you may consider other departments as well. The goals are (1) to infer the average level of collaborative versus methodological research at each department and (2) to compare these values across statistics and biostatistics departments. What can you conclude about the differences in faculty activities based on your analyses?

### The Data:

You should collect the data from Google Scholar, Pubmed, Departmental Websites, or any other resource you can think of. You are encouraged to work together on the data collection portion of this assignment.

### Submission requirements


Your report must be no longer than 4 pages ( <= 2,000 words) with 3 display items. You may include up to 2 pages of supplementary equations/description. Your report must be in the form of a pdf. You must also submit R code to perform your analyses (in the form of a .Rmd file). The R code must run in under 2 hours start to finish.

_Reproducibility_

Your reproducibility score will be determined by whether your code can be run without error and produces all numbers/figures in your main text. Please include library requirements at the beginning of your script and an estimate of the approximate runtime. Please also submit the compiled HTML from knitting your Rmd file. Comments are not required, but I will only try to fix code that is liberally and accurately commented.

### Submission location

Please submit to the CoursePlus Dropbox for the final project.
